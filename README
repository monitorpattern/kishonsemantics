This directory contains the experiment of the paper of Kishon, Hudak and Consel.

  "Monitoring Semantics : A Formal Framework for Specifying, Implementing,
and Reasoning about Execution Monitors"

- fixpoint.ml is a library provided by okmij people (the ones who
  implemented delimcc)
  
- monitor.ml is a not compiled file. It serves as a template for implementing
  monitors

- llambda*.ml are the files implementing a simple typed lambda calculus,
  the language from the paper.

- demon*.ml, tracer*.ml, collectingMonitor*.ml are faithfull implementations of the paper's example.

How to compile:

- run make. It will generate one executable file named "llambda"
It executes all of the anonymous let definitions contained in the ml files
(let _ = ...)
